# Changelog

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (2026-09-18)


### Bug Fixes

* **plugin:** wire releases to the plugin manifests, add the Codex marketplace ([#5](https://github.com/racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp/issues/5)) ([0cf4339](https://github.com/racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp/commit/0cf4339577911899b292a60e70138f57dc38c07f))


### Miscellaneous Chores

* release 0.5.0 ([9ace23b](https://github.com/racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp/commit/9ace23b3ea3eab1e89960697b165758434b7dd26))

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/itsmostafa/typesafe-mcp/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2026-09-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `jev` is now `evaluate`. Installed 0.3.x binaries look for a `jev-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` asset, so `jev update` fails against this release and cannot self-update across the rename; reinstall with install.sh, then re-run `evaluate setup mcp`. `JEV_INSTALL_DIR` is no longer read, and `go install .../cmd/jev@latest` no longer resolves.
* `jev mcp setup` is now `jev setup mcp`.

### Features

* move mcp setup under jev setup and add jev setup pi ([6a74477](https://github.com/itsmostafa/typesafe-mcp/commit/6a7447759fa2dea329064d544e3b12b1a0521fb9))
