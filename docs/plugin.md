# Installing as a plugin

This repository is also a plugin for Claude Code and Codex. Installing it gives
a client both halves at once: the `evaluate` MCP tool, and TypeSafe's agent
skill adapted to use it.

The alternative is [openrouter.md](openrouter.md), which registers the MCP
server by hand with no plugin involved. Both paths run the same binary. Use one.

## What is in the plugin

The payload lives in `plugin/`, and the two marketplace files at the repository
root point at it. That separation is what a client caches: everything outside
`plugin/` (the Go source, the eval suite, the docs) stays out of it.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | marketplace entry, source `./plugin` |
| `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | marketplace entry Codex prefers, source `./plugin` |
| `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Claude Code manifest |
| `plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Codex manifest |
| `plugin/mcp/claude.json` | MCP entry for Claude Code |
| `plugin/.mcp.json` | MCP entry for Codex |
| `plugin/shared-skills/typesafe-ai/` | TypeSafe's skill, adapted, with its MIT licence |
| `plugin/shared-skills/typed-judgments/` | routes an in-session judgment to the tool |
| `plugin/bin/evaluate-launch` | resolves the binary and applies plugin defaults |

Both manifests declare the same name and version, which a test enforces.

## One thing the plugin cannot carry

**The server binary is not in the plugin.** It is compiled Go, and committing
four platform builds to git would bloat every clone and still miss a fifth
platform. So the binary is installed once, separately, and `plugin/bin/evaluate-launch`
finds it.

If it is missing, the launcher writes one line to stderr naming the install
command and exits. Stdout stays clean, because a human-readable line there is a
frame the MCP client cannot parse.

## Install

**1. The binary**, once:

```sh
task install
# or, from a release:
#   curl -fsSL -o install.sh \
#     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp/main/install.sh
#   sh install.sh
```

Both put it at `~/.local/libexec/racecraft-jev/evaluate`. Set `EVALUATE_BIN` if
you keep it elsewhere.

**2. The credential**, once. The plugin uses TypeSafe first and OpenRouter as
its fallback, each with its own key file. Either one is enough:

```sh
mkdir -p -m 700 ~/.config/racecraft-jev
cat > ~/.config/racecraft-jev/typesafe.key      # paste, then ctrl-d
chmod 600 ~/.config/racecraft-jev/typesafe.key
cat > ~/.config/racecraft-jev/openrouter.key    # the fallback
chmod 600 ~/.config/racecraft-jev/openrouter.key
```

The launcher sets `JEV_API_KEY_FILE` to the primary's file and
`JEV_FALLBACK_API_KEY_FILE` to the fallback's, each only when it is not already
set, so an explicit value in the client's environment still wins. A missing
TypeSafe key starts the server on OpenRouter; a missing OpenRouter key leaves
TypeSafe serving alone. No credential
is stored in any manifest, and a test checks for that.

**3. The plugin.** Each client reads its own marketplace file from this
repository, so the same source works for both.

Claude Code:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp --scope user
claude plugin install typesafe-jev@racecraft-typesafe --scope user
```

Codex, which has no scope flag because marketplaces are global under `~/.codex`:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add racecraft-lab/typesafe-mcp
codex plugin add typesafe-jev@racecraft-typesafe
```

Restart the client afterwards. Both commands track `main`. To pin, append
`@<tag>` to the Claude source or pass `--ref <tag>` to Codex; no release tag
exists for this fork yet.

Codex reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` when it is present and falls back
to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` when it is not, so it could install this
plugin before the Codex marketplace file existed. `codex plugin list` prints the
file it chose. The Codex file is still worth keeping: it is where the display
name, category and installation policy Codex shows belong, and the fallback is
behaviour rather than a documented contract.

Claude Code and Codex both change these commands from time to time. Check
`claude plugin --help` and `codex plugin --help` if either is rejected.

## Replaces the official TypeSafe plugin

Install this **instead of** TypeSafe's `typesafe` plugin, not alongside it.

Both ship a skill named `typesafe-ai`, so installing both is a collision. More
importantly, upstream's skill teaches an agent to write SDK or HTTP code against
the TypeSafe API. That is right when building an application and wrong when a
judgment is needed in the current session and the tool is already connected. The
vendored copy adds a section that makes the distinction, and leaves the rest of
upstream's text alone.

Provenance is recorded in the file's own header: `typesafe-ai/skills`, plugin
version 0.5.7, MIT, with the licence kept beside it. A test asserts the licence,
the provenance, and that upstream's guidance survived the edit.

When TypeSafe publishes a new skill version, re-vendor it and re-apply the two
additions rather than editing around the old copy.

## Defaults the plugin sets

```json
"env": {
  "JEV_PROVIDER": "typesafe",
  "JEV_MODEL": "jev-latest",
  "JEV_FALLBACK_PROVIDER": "openrouter",
  "JEV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT": "45s"
}
```

The plugin names both backends explicitly: TypeSafe first, and OpenRouter as the
fallback it opts in to with `JEV_FALLBACK_PROVIDER`. Nothing infers a backend
from which keys happen to be set. A call moves to OpenRouter only when TypeSafe
refuses its credential (401, 402, 403), is not found (404), throttles (429),
fails (5xx) or cannot be reached. The session then stays on OpenRouter, and the
switch is one line on stderr. A request TypeSafe rejected by shape never moves.
Both backends share the one 45s budget, so the client's 75s abort still fits.
To pin one backend, set `JEV_PROVIDER` and remove `JEV_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` in the
client's own configuration for this server.

The Codex entry also sets `tool_timeout_sec: 75`, above the 45s request budget,
so the client does not give up while the server is still inside the time it was
given.

## Codex: take the tool out of code mode

Codex routes MCP tools through code mode by default, and this one does not work
well there. Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`, adding only the line if the table
already exists:

```toml
[features.code_mode]
direct_only_tool_namespaces = ["mcp__jev"]
```

The namespace follows the server name in `.mcp.json`, which is `jev` here. A
plugin cannot set this setting; it is the operator's own configuration.

## Rollback

Remove the plugin with your client's plugin command. That removes the tool and
the skill together, and touches neither client's own model nor its
authentication.

The binary and the key file are outside the plugin and survive it. Delete
`~/.local/libexec/racecraft-jev/evaluate` and the key file separately if you
want them gone, and revoke the key only when you mean to.
